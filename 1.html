            <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages.
                It stands for Hypertext Markup Language.HTML consists of a series of elements, which are the building blocks of a web page.
                Each element is represented by a tag, enclosed in angle brackets.
                CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.
                It enhances the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements. CSS allows you to control the fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning of HTML elements.
                It works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is mainly employed for client-side scripting, meaning it runs in the user's browser.
                This allows it to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, enabling dynamic changes to the content and structure of a webpage without requiring a page reload.</p>
